Duration

The duration logical type represents an amount of time defined by a number of months, days and milliseconds.
This is not equivalent to a number of milliseconds, because, depending on the moment in time from which the
duration is measured, the number of days in the month and number of milliseconds in a day may differ. Other
standard periods such as years, quarters, hours and minutes can be expressed through these basic periods.

A duration logical type annotates Avro fixed type of size 12, which stores three little-endian unsigned
integers that represent durations at different granularities of time. The first stores a number in months,
the second stores a number in days, and the third stores a number in milliseconds.
